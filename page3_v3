<p> Modern music is very different from what is was before. Music first arose in the Paleothic Era. 
		Singing may have appeared before this time, but this is unfortunately impossible to confirm.
		The oldest instrument according to science, is the Divje Babe Flute from
		the Divje Babe cave in Slovenia, dated to 43,000 and 82,000. The instrument was made from a cave bear femur. </p>
	
<p> Nowdays, music is still prevelant in society. 
	Music is an essential in civilisation and has the power to emotionally, morally and culturally affect society. When people from one culture exchange music
	with another, they gain valuable insight into another way of life. This shows the power of music and how deeply rooted it is within us all.</p>
	
<p> Many find music stale compared to what it used to be. This should inspire others to pursue creating more original music rather than being contantly inspired by other artists, creating unique music is something 
	I believe our society should focus on more. Audio! Interface is a music streaming service that aims to achieve this.</p>
